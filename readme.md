# Moody Chart
The purpose of this is to be able to create a custom moody chart to print out on a PDF. See the PDF's for the
results. The reason why I did this was because I wanted a chart that stretched across an entire page. 

Adjust the parameters at the beginning of `moody_chart.py` to your liking. 

There is no use of numerical solvers unlike some other moody charts I've seen. Instead, I used the Haaland equation to
gather data for the relative roughness lines. In fact, I think I'll never use this chart ever because I could just
program my TI-84 to get a more precise solution. 

FYI, both axis have a logarithmic scale, which is typical for these moody charts.
